NOTE: While there are bugs and it is not a very interesting game, this was my first attempt at creating a 2D game in JavaScript.
This program uses the React library. 
Play The Game: https://l47o2x30v9.codesandbox.io/


The player is blue, enemies are red, and targerts are green.  Use the arrow keys to eat targets and avoid enemies.
As you eat the smaller "players" you will grow in size and eventually be big enough that your enemies turn into targets.  
For the time being, you will need to refresh the page to replay the game.
